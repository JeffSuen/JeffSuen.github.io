<h2>Overview</h2>

The gaming industry has boomed over the last few years, but there are many times where we do not have friends to play with. And this becomes an issue for lonely college students that are stuck to playing by themselves. It offers students a chance to meet new players who are students and have the same interest.

<h3>The Solution:</h3>
 League Manoa has two user roles, which is accessible to anyone. The first role is that of a player who is looking to join a room that someone else has already decided to open up for applications to play together. The other role is the Game Master, the person who is in charge of opening and managing their room, who is looking to take charge of who to make friends with.

One of the most important part about this is to make sure everyone is able to play on the same schedule and this will ensure it easier to find people that work well with a person's schedule. The application should support browsing through available times and what role they want to play. 

<h3>Mockup Page Ideas:</h3>

Possible mockup pages

<h3>Case Ideas</h3>
Game master goes into landing pages,logs in, and then hosting page publishes a game and time  for people to join.

Prospective players goes to landing page, logs in, and then lobby page to search games to see what fits their schedule and roles, and joins the game.

<h3>Beyond the Basics</h3>
Basic Communication : a comment section forpeople to talk about the game
