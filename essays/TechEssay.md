From the start it's been pretty clear that I had a certain affinity with technology. I grew up around the age of dial-up and had the fortunacy to see the internet and modern technology develop and grow to become what it is now. Now that I'm in the computer science field I can finally see for myself what runs behind the scenes of my smartphone or what's really happening when I run a computer on my program. I believe it all to be very intriguing, though challenging but a little struggle goes a long way for you.

With the current Software Engineering class that I'm in, I have just started to learn to use Javascript and I'm starting to see for myself why so much interest lies within it. I may not have as deep of an understanding that I would like of the language yet, but I hope to master it and make great use out of it to make things such as websites and potentially mobile apps as well. 

I see software engineering becoming very integral in shaping the way that I think about development and the ways that I can use it to either enhance my life, another's, or evensomething in the future that hasn't even been explored yet. I think the very prospect of it is very self fulfilling and makes me feel good that I can use the skills I learn to pave way for a better future not only for myself, but potentially everyone else in the world.
