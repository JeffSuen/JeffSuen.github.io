Javascript feels to be a very uniquely utilitarian tool approachable for the novice and familiar enough for the veteran. I lie somewhere in between as I've studied using Java and C in the past where I consider those two languages to be opposite in terms of learning curve and ease of access. As I have only been programming and learning computer science for two years, my opinion of the Javascript language reflects only what I've learned so far and the things that I've seen it do, or heard that it can do.

I believe that the language itself is simple in the fact that it eliminates a lot of the basic starters that a student may normally have to pick up in a language such as Java where you start off with the primitive types of data and learn to separate data groups entirely to have a more structured set of thinking. When it comes to JS, however, that is eliminated almost entirely with the language recognizing variables as it is without separating them by type. As good of a thing this seemed to be when I first started learning this language, I can see how this might pose as a problem to potentially newer programmers or maybe even in a program or function that relies on user interface.

Speaking for the subject of new students, my younger brother in high school who learned Javascript wiithout a formal structured teaching experience encountered great difficulty in grasping the concepts of the language as a whole. I can imagine many pitfalls as a new student who wouldn't know how to write code specific to the way they wish to handle their data.

As for my ICS 314 Software Engineering class that has got me learning Javascript, I like the design of the class and the way that we're almost forced to keep up and learn more intensively. I'm definitely not used to working like this but as such I'm gradually finding a way to ease into this pace of learning and workflow. I can say that I'm excited to see where this semester takes me and how far I can push myself with not only learning Javascript, but just the basics overall of good software engineering.
