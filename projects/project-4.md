StuddBudd is an online web-app designed by 5 students in the UH Manoa ICS 314 Software engineering course of Fall 2018 to help students find willing mentors to tutor them in a specific subjects. To start this off, please feel free to browse through our github page if you'd like: [click me!](https://studbudd.github.io/). This page contains instructions for installation alongside some of our progress across our three major milestones for this project.

This project was designed with the Semantic-UI React framework to aid us novice web developers in making a site that was equally both functional and aesthetic. With our basic knowledge of HTML and CSS that we picked up in the middle of the semester, it was up to us to provide the creativity and diligence towards a project of which none of us have had the experience in before. Not only was it eye opening (maybe eye closing with the lack of sleep making things work), but it was also fun to our surprise. Within the rigidity that we tend to fit into as undergraduate students, this was the first time that we got to make something free-hand, so to speak.

My specific contributions to this project lied mainly in the back-end development, with my front-end work primarily being adjusting an application form and applying CSS to my components for cohesive theming. Although we ran into collisions with the forming of our database due to miscommunication, I had a big hand in unraveling the mysteries behind how files utilized our data collections and how to connect them. It was analogous to taking apart a big lego project then figuring out how to rebuild it from scratch. 

A lot of the hurdles in this project came from small miscommunications and decentralized decisions all of which beautifully got fixed within the last milestone. Because we managed to mostly stay on the same page, our faults never derailed us and made for a relatively smooth ride the entire time. I'm proud to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this project and think that I've found something that truly interests me in this field of study. If I had the chance to work on something like this again, I'd confidently bring along all the technical and team-building skills that I acquired from this project.
