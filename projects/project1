In high school I took the up the role of making an eSports club which comprised of over 50 members at the time. The premise of the club was
based around my increasing involvement and interest in the local and national eSports community. I wanted to bring the excitement and feelling
of inclusion to my own community within school and foster a sense of teamwork and comraderie that you'd only typically find in a traditional
sport.
